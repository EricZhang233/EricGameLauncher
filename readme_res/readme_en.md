## Introduction

**Eric Game Launcher** is a next-generation game launcher built for minimalists. It discards the bloat of traditional platforms, leveraging the power of **WinUI 3** and **.NET 8** to provide millisecond-level startup experiences and native Windows 11 visual enjoyment.

Whether your games are from Steam, Epic, or independent exe files, this is their unified home.

## Features

### Built for Gamers
*   **Ultra-Lightweight**: Start as needed, leave when done. No background services, zero ads, and system resource usage is nearly zero.
*   **Efficient Search**: Supports English initial matching, space-separated first letters, and CamelCase matching. Want to play "League of Legends"? Just type "LOL" for instant results.
*   **Professional-Grade Property Control**: This isn't just a basic shortcut.
    *   **Run as Administrator**: Separately configure elevation for the "Game Main Program" and "Game Manager" (e.g., Steam/Epic), solving issues where insufficient permissions prevent startup.
    *   **Run Manager**: Supports configuring the manager path to ensure the game not only starts but also correctly triggers platform services.
    *   **Full Parameter Support**: All paths for the main program, manager, alternative startup, and companion programs support **command-line arguments** or **URL Protocols**.
    *   **Replace Main Executable**: Check this to use a custom command (e.g., `starward://`) to completely replace the original EXE's startup logic.
        > 💡 **Pro Tip**: Keep the game cover in EGL, but actually call an external tool (like Starward) to launch the game and track playtime.
    *   **Execute Simultaneously on Startup**: Want to automatically open a translator, timer, or performance monitor when playing? Configure this for one-click dual launch.
    *   **Change Icon**: Supports manual image uploads for covers—a savior for those with OCD.
    *   **Custom Context Menu**: Add up to 10 custom menu items for each project.
        *   Independently configure titles, command paths, and arguments.
        *   Toggle "Run as Administrator" for each custom item.
        *   **Smart Shifting**: Subsequent items automatically shift up when an intermediate item is deleted to keep the list compact.
    *   **Icon Size**: From compact lists to immersive large grids, customize as you wish.

### Designed for Geeks
*   **Fully Portable Mode**: Supports storing all data (configurations, cached icons) in the program directory. Put it on a USB drive, carry your game library with you, and run it on any computer.
*   **Seamless Data Migration**: Want to switch from system installation mode to portable mode? One-click migration automatically moves all configurations and icons without reconfiguration.
*   **Smart Icon Extraction**: Automatically parses `.exe`, `.lnk`, and even Steam/Epic URL protocols to extract and cache high-definition icons.

## Technical Highlights

For developers, Eric Game Launcher demonstrates how to build modern Windows desktop applications with minimal code:

*   **Cutting-Edge Stack**: Built on the latest **Windows App SDK (1.6+)** and **.NET 8**, showcasing the great potential of WinUI 3 in desktop applications.
*   **Native Performance**:
    *   Utilizes `P/Invoke` (User32.dll) for efficient system-level icon extraction.
    *   Uses `System.Text.Json` for high-performance, low-memory data serialization.
*   **Clean Architecture**:
    *   **Efficient Data Binding**: Smooth UI interactions achieved through `ObservableCollection` and XAML binding, with clear and intuitive code logic.
    *   **Static Service Design**: Core modules like `ConfigService` and `I18n` use static classes for zero-overhead calls, remaining minimalist and efficient.
*   **Modern Build**:
    *   **Unpackaged Deployment**: Skips the tedious MSIX packaging and certificate importation, directly generating a green and pure `.exe` executable.

## Quick Start

### Users
1.  Go to the [Releases](../../releases) page and download the latest version.
2.  Extract and run `EricGameLauncher.exe`.
3.  Click **"More" -> "Add"** in the top right corner, then select a game shortcut or executable.

## Contribution & Support

We welcome any form of contribution! Whether it's submitting bugs, improving documentation, or submitting code (PRs).

If you find this project helpful, please give it a heart-felt ⭐️ **Star**!

## Special Thanks / Links
*   [**Starward**](https://github.com/Scighost/Starward): A powerful Mihoyo game launcher. Our initial vision for this project was just a collection launcher for local games, with no plans to support distribution platforms. The reason we initially supported URL-scheme protocols was to support Starward's protocol for recording playtime in Mihoyo games. Later, we thought if we already support URL-schemes, why not support protocols from platforms like Steam/Epic? Thus, the current feature of supporting distribution platform launchers was born. Starward's innovation and contribution in the field of Mihoyo game launchers are indelible. We hope to pay tribute by supporting its protocol and provide players with more choices. With this opportunity, our launcher should support the vast majority of launcher URL-scheme protocols and parameterised execution.
*   [**Snap Hutao**](https://github.com/DGP-Studio/Snap.Hutao): Thanks to its team for their past outstanding contributions. It was the most powerful Genshin Impact toolbox I ever used. Although its curtain has closed, its open-source spirit will be passed on, inspiring those who follow. [**R.I.P**](https://hut.ao/)
*   [**Snap Hutao Remastered**](https://github.com/SnapHutaoRemasteringProject/Snap.Hutao.Remastered): A remaster of Snap Hutao. Dedicated to continuing the original features and revitalising them on a modern tech stack. Respect! This is also the toolbox I currently use when playing Genshin Impact.
